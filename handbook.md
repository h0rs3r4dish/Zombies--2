### Appendix A: Preferences

Players can set the following preferences for their characters:

* `starting-weapon-class` determines what kind of weapon you want to start with.
  Accepts `random` (default), `melee`, or `ranged`.
  

### Appendix B: Map Making

Maps are easy to make, being only linked rooms described in plain text. This
chapter will describe the options availible to a mapmaker.

Before you begin, every map must be in some kind of campaign. All this requires
is for the map to be stored in a subfolder of `data/maps/`; for example, all of
the legacy maps from Zombies! 1 are in the "legacy" campaign, which can be
found at `data/maps/legacy/`. Maps should be saved as plain text with the `.map`
extension.
