start-text: You find yourselves on a street corner, staring at a broken down Exxon gas station. The place appears to be covered in zombies. A radio you found said the military is sending troops to help people out of zombie-infested areas, but they won't be here for a while.

objective: Clear out the Exxon and hold your position in the building until help arrives. You've failed if there's a zombie in the gas station when the timer's up.
