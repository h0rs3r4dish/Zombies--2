Zombies! 2
==========

The successor to the Zombies! IRC game (run by the Quander bot), this is a more
advanced and platform-independant derivative.

Usage
-----

This project isn't meant to be used as-is. Maps should be added, as well as
a decent frontend. There *is* a simple console that can be run via:

	$ ruby bin/console
	
This provides a simple wrapper for the Zombies::Game class, and can be seen as
an example on which to build your own. As long as the provider has access to the
object, any sort of medium can be used for play.
